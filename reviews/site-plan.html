      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 07 - Fill in your purpose. In 2–3 sentences, write the purpose statement from your elevator pitch -->
      <p>One of the problems I see with modern review websites is that they are run by professionals, people who are paid to consume a product (whether a movie, video game, or music). They do that day in and day out, but the people reading these reviews are typically casual and have different values. That's where I come in, a regular guy reviewing video games. I will tell you what you actually want to know, not only what some critic values.</p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 07 - write about your intended audience. Who are they? How old are they? Why will they be using your site? What do you want them to do? -->
      <p>My audience is primarily casual gamers aged 12-35 who are looking for honest, relatable reviews of video games. They want to know if a game is worth their time and money, and they appreciate a down-to-earth perspective that speaks to their own gaming experiences.</p>

        Most game reviews you find online are either done by paid professionals from a company or online personalities, often paid to review content or given the game for free. These reviewers have different values and standards from the average gamer. That’s where I come in: a regular gamer reviewing games. I will tell you what you want to know, and if a game is worth your hard-earned money.
<br><br>Instead of expensive OLED TVs and high-end gaming monitors that other reviewers use, I play on the same budget 4K and 1080p screens that many American families own. I also use the same consoles and modest PC hardware for my reviews, instead of thousand-dollar parts.
<br><br>I have been playing video games for almost my whole life, and I haven’t gotten sick of it yet. Personally, the most important thing about a game is whether the gameplay is fun or not. Everything else is secondary to me.  Some of my favorite all-time games and franchises, and the ones I keep coming back to, include Super Mario, Halo, Super Smash Bros, Fortnite, Call of Duty, Mario, and Sonic the Hedgehog.

      <h3>Mario Kart Wii Review</h3>
      <p>Game Review 1: Mario Kart Wii
As you may know, the Nintendo Switch 2 was recently released for $450 along with a new entry in the Mario Kart series, Mario Kart World, for $80 or $500 in a bundle. There has been limited stock of the new console, and I think I will wait for more games to come out or a good sale to happen before pulling the trigger and buying it. In the meantime, I have been revisiting some of my old favorites on the Nintendo Wii. One of them has been Mario Kart Wii, which I will be reviewing here.
<br><br>Gameplay: Regarding the gameplay, MKWii is a very accessible game that I feel most people could pick up and play easily. It supports traditional controls if you use the GameCube or Wii Classic Controller (except tricking is on the control pad instead of the shoulder buttons, as in Mario Kart 7 or 8). You can also use the Wii remote’s motion controls and play as if you were driving a real car. Mario Kart Wii introduced motorbikes to the series, and I’d say they feel the best in the game. The physics are floaty, but not too floaty, where you feel empowered after doing a trick in the air or completing a shortcut. The speedrun community has thrived with Mario Kart Wii, with shortcuts seen as impossible being performed. Even with newer entries, people keep returning to this game because it is so fun to play.
<br><br>Another reason people return is for the aesthetics and soundtrack. The background music from tracks such as Coconut Mall, DK Summit, and Rainbow Road has entered internet culture, being used in YouTube videos and TikTok galore. The character models look a little worse than in the GameCube’s Mario Kart Double Dash, but the stages look a lot better and hold up even today.
<br><br>This game remains one of my favorites, and I highly recommend it, whether you already own it or are looking to buy a used Wii and a copy. There are mods that add custom stages and restore online play, but that is beyond the scope here.

      <h3>Sonic Adventure Review</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        There is a meme out there that goes “Sonic had a rough transition to 3D”, implying that his games from the early 2000s are not good, despite the positive reception given to Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 at release. To try and settle the issue, and answer the question of “Should you play Sonic Adventure?” I’ve decided to review it. 
<br><br>Ports: Sonic Adventure was originally released for the SEGA Dreamcast and was later ported to GameCube as Sonic Adventure DX. The releases on Xbox 360 (which is backwards compatible with newer Xbox consoles), PS3, and PC through Steam are based on DX. Sonic Adventure DX is considered a bad port of the Dreamcast original, both in gameplay and visuals, and this probably contributes to the notion that the game is bad. There are mods for the Steam version of SADX that restore it closer to the original game or combine the best of both versions, and I am reviewing this game with those fixes in mind.
<br><br>Gameplay: There are 6 main stories in Sonic Adventure DX. Sonic, Tails, and Amy include platforming and race to the finish levels, though Amy is significantly slower. These are probably my favorite type of levels in this game, and the controls feel good even for a game of its age. It accurately translates the gameplay from Sonic 3 and Knuckles into 3D. It is fun to go fast or beat Sonic in a race as Tails. 
<br><br>Knuckles’ levels involve him treasure hunting around a level, and E102-Gamma’s levels involve shooting as many enemies as you can. They are fun for different reasons than Sonic or Tails. The final character you play is Big the Cat, who goes fishing after his best friend Froggy. I don’t like Big’s levels as they slow down a game that is otherwise fast. He is a roadblock to getting to the final story. But overall, the gameplay is fun with every other character. 
<br><br>Sonic Adventure also has a compelling story that links the various levels and characters. The dialogue is cheesy, in a “so bad that it is good” kind of way. The soundtrack is filled with “bangers”, and I slightly prefer this game’s music to Adventure 2’s. Overall, I would say Sonic Adventure is a good game, and Sonic had a good transition into 3D, at least as well as Mario’s. SADX is currently $8 on Steam, $2 if you grab it on a sale. It can run on most PCs, and I say it’s worth the money.
