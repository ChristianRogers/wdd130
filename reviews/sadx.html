                <p>There is a meme out there that goes “Sonic had a rough transition to 3D”, implying that his games from the early 2000s are not good, despite the positive reception given to Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 at release. To try and settle the issue, and answer the question of “Should you play Sonic Adventure?” I’ve decided to review it.</p>

            <p>Sonic Adventure was originally released for the SEGA Dreamcast and was later ported to GameCube as Sonic Adventure DX. The releases on Xbox 360 (which is backwards compatible with newer Xbox consoles), PS3, and PC through Steam are based on DX. Sonic Adventure DX is considered a bad port of the Dreamcast original, both in gameplay and visuals, and this probably contributes to the notion that the game is bad. There are mods for the Steam version of SADX that restore it closer to the original game or combine the best of both versions, and I am reviewing this game with those fixes in mind.</p>

            <h2> Gameplay </h2>
            <img src="images/sonic_running.jpg" alt="Sonic Adventure Gameplay">
            <p>There are 6 main stories in Sonic Adventure DX. Sonic, Tails, and Amy include platforming and race to the finish levels, though Amy is significantly slower. These are probably my favorite type of levels in this game, and the controls feel good even for a game of its age. It accurately translates the gameplay from Sonic 3 and Knuckles into 3D. It is fun to go fast or beat Sonic in a race as Tails.</p>

                <img src="images/knuckles.jpg" alt="Knuckles the Echidna">
                <p>Knuckles’ levels involve him treasure hunting around a level, and E102-Gamma’s levels involve shooting as many enemies as you can. They are fun for different reasons than Sonic or Tails. 
                    The final character you play is Big the Cat, who goes fishing after his best friend Froggy. I don’t like Big’s levels as they slow down a game that is otherwise fast. He is a roadblock to getting to the final story. But overall, the gameplay is fun with every other character.</p>

            <h2> Other Thoughts </h2>
            <p>Sonic Adventure also has a compelling story that links the various levels and characters. The dialogue is cheesy, in a “so bad that it is good” kind of way. The soundtrack is filled with “bangers”, and I slightly prefer this game’s music to Adventure 2’s. Overall, I would say Sonic Adventure is a good game, and Sonic had a good transition into 3D, at least as well as Mario’s. SADX is currently $8 on Steam, $2 if you grab it on a sale. It can run on most PCs, and I say it’s worth the money.</p>
