            <h2> Background </h2>
            <p> Mario Kart Wii As you may know, the Nintendo Switch 2 was recently released for $450 along with a new entry in the Mario Kart series, Mario Kart World, for $80 or $500 in a bundle. There has been limited stock of the new console, and I think I will wait for more games to come out or a good sale to happen before pulling the trigger and buying it. In the meantime, I have been revisiting some of my old favorites on the Nintendo Wii. One of them has been Mario Kart Wii, which I will be reviewing here.</p>

            <h2> Gameplay </h2>
            <p> Regarding the gameplay, MKWii is a very accessible game that I feel most people could pick up and play easily. It supports traditional controls if you use the GameCube or Wii Classic Controller (except tricking is on the control pad instead of the shoulder buttons, as in Mario Kart 7 or 8). You can also use the Wii remote’s motion controls and play as if you were driving a real car. Mario Kart Wii introduced motorbikes to the series, and I’d say they feel the best in the game. The physics are floaty, but not too floaty, where you feel empowered after doing a trick in the air or completing a shortcut. The speedrun community has thrived with Mario Kart Wii, with shortcuts seen as impossible being performed. Even with newer entries, people keep returning to this game because it is so fun to play</p>

                <p>Luigi is my favorite character to play as in the game, as he has a good weight and acceleration stat. The mach bike is among the fastest in the game, and many speedrunners use it for that reason.</p>
            </div>

            <h2> Graphics and Sound </h2>
            <p>Another reason people return is for the aesthetics and soundtrack. The background music from tracks such as Coconut Mall, DK Summit, and Rainbow Road has entered internet culture, being used in YouTube videos and TikTok galore. The character models look a little worse than in the GameCube’s Mario Kart Double Dash, but the stages look a lot better and hold up even today.</p>

            <img src="images/mkwii_podium.jpg" alt="Mario Kart Wii Podium">

            <p>This game remains one of my favorites, and I highly recommend it, whether you already own it or are looking to buy a used Wii and a copy. There are mods that add custom stages and restore online play, but that is beyond the scope here.</p>
